## About Cinema for web and Cinem made with code

> We try to organize here links for websites that use code and video to tell stories. Cinema for web is about movies that use a website to create a interactive experience, like [Rio: Beyond the Map](https://beyondthemap.withgoogle.com/). Cinema made with code is about movies created with code, like [The Good Man](http://thegoodman.cc/) (that use CSS and audio to tell a story).
